# JohnWatson
Voice Assistant in Python with help of Google Speech to text API
Note: John was created out of interest and was made for my person use. Inspired by the Jarvis from Iron Man Movies and John Watson from Sherlock Holmes series.

System requirements: Python version 3, Google Chrome Browser. Also, make sure to install all the libraries that are in the beginning of the code.

Commands John can listen to:
1. Hello (eg: Hey, Hey John, Hi Johnny, Hello John)
2. What is your name?
3. What are you doing?
4. How are you?
5. Time (eg: Whats the time Johnny? , Can you please tell me the time?) [key word: the time]
6. Toss a coin
